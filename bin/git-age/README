A git-blame viewer, written using PyGTK.
Shows the file with information on author, commit etc on each
line. Also colors the background of the line darker for older commits
and lighter for newer commits. Useful for quickly seeing what parts of
a file have changed recently.

Will also attempt to retrieve Gravatars for all authors in the file
asynchronously.
